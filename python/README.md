# üöÄ Rackspace Spot SDK Script Runner

The Python script demonstrates how to use the **Rackspace Spot SDK** for orchestrating cloud resources such as cloudspaces, spot pools, and on-demand pools. You can execute a **Complete Scenario**, a **Full Deployment**, or **both**, depending on the flags provided.

---

## üìö Overview

The Rackspace Spot SDK provides tools to manage cloud resources programmatically. This script helps you:

- Understand the complete lifecycle of Rackspace Spot resources.
- Simulate production-like workflows.
- Validate integration in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## üß™ Scenario Types

### ‚úÖ Complete Scenario

Simulates a full Rackspace Spot workflow:

- Lists available **regions** and **server classes**.
- Creates a **cloudspace**, one **spot pool**, and one **on-demand pool**.
- Lists all created resources.
- Cleans up the created resources.

> Use this to understand the SDK's capabilities in a simple, guided flow.

---

### ‚úÖ Full Deployment

Simulates a scalable deployment lifecycle with three stages:

1. **Create Environment**: Provisions one cloudspace and multiple spot/on-demand pools based on `dynamic_pools_config.py`.
2. **Get Environment**: Lists all created resources.
3. **Cleanup Environment**: Tears down the created resources.

> Ideal for integration testing or use in automation pipelines.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

### üîß Requirements

- Python **3.8** or newer
- A **refresh token** from Rackspace Spot

> On macOS/Linux, use `python3` and `pip3` if `python` defaults to Python 2.

---

### üîë How to Obtain a Refresh Token

1. Go to: [Rackspace Spot API Access Page](https://spot.rackspace.com/ui/api-access/terraform)
2. Navigate to **API Access > Terraform**
3. Click **Get New Token**
4. Use the **refresh token** in the script

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo_url>
cd python

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üì¶ Script Description
This script accepts a required OAuth --refresh-token and one of the flags:

| Argument                 | Description                               
| ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------
| `--refresh-token`        | OAuth refresh token (Always required)
| `--complete-scenario`    | To run the complete scenario 
| `--full-deployment`      | To run the full deployment


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è The script will exit if neither scenario (complete-scenario or full-deployment) is enabled.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Examples
### ‚úÖ 1. Run Only the Complete Scenario (Default Behavior)
You can simply run the script with your refresh token:

```bash
python main.py --refresh-token <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN> --complete-scenario
```

## ‚úÖ 2. Run Only the Full Deployment
To run just the full deployment and skip the complete scenario:

```bash
python main.py --refresh-token <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN> --full-deployment
```

## ‚úÖ 3. Run Both Scenarios
This will execute both scenarios one after another:

```bash
python main.py --refresh-token <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN> --complete-scenario --full-deployment
```

## ‚ùå 4. Run Neither Scenario (Invalid ‚Äì Will Exit)
This will result in an error because no scenarios are selected:

```bash
python main.py --refresh-token <YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>
```
Output:

```bash 
Please provide the --complete-scenario or --full-deployment argument to run the examples.
```

## üì¶ Configuration Options
Edit dynamic_pools_config.py to customize:

- Number of spot pools

- Number of on-demand pools

- Resource specifications

- If you wish to choose a different serverclass (which may also depend on the region where your Cloudspace is deployed or available), please refer to the Public API documentation in the Additional References section below.

### Additional References:
All public available APIs can be found in the [Rackspace Spot Public API Documentation](https://spot.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-spot-public-api)

## üß© Usecase
- **Complete Scenario**: Useful for understanding the end-to-end flow of resource creation and how the Rackspace Spot system works. Ideal for first-time users exploring the SDK.
- **Full Deployment**: Designed for CI/CD pipelines to test the system's functionality and resource orchestration in environments that closely resemble production.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

- Verify your Python version meets the minimum requirement (3.8+)
- Ensure your refresh token is valid and has the necessary permissions
- Check that all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify you're in the correct directory (python folder)
